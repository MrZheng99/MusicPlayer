I see your monsters
I see your pain
Tell me your problems
I'll chase them away
I'll be your lighthouse
I'll make it okay
When I see your monsters
I'll stand there so brave
And chase them all away
In the dark we we
We stand apart we we
Never see that the things we need are staring right at us
You just want to hide hide hide
Never show your smile smile
Stand alone when you need someone
It’s the hardest thing of all
That you see are the bad bad bad memories
Take your time you'll find me
I see your monsters
I see your pain
Tell me your problems
I'll chase them away
I'll be your lighthouse
I'll make it okay
When I see your monsters
I'll stand there so brave
And chase them all away
I can see the sky
Beautiful tonight
When you breathe why can’t you see
The clouds are in your head
I would stay there
No need to fear
When you need to talk it out with someone you can trust
What you see are the bad bad bad memories
Take your time you'll find me
I see your monsters
I see your pain
Tell me your problems
I'll chase them away
I'll be your lighthouse
I'll make it okay
When I see your monsters
I'll stand there so brave
And chase them all away
You've got the chance to see the light
Even in the darkest night
And I will be here like you were for me
So just let me in
I see your monsters
I see your pain
Tell me your problems
I'll chase them away
I see your monsters
I see your pain
Tell me your problems
I'll chase them away
I'll be your lighthouse
I'll make it okay
When I see your monsters
I'll stand there so brave
I see your monsters
I see your pain
Tell me your problems
I'll chase them away
I'll be your lighthouse
I'll make it okay
When I see your monsters
I'll stand there so brave
And chase them all away
When I see your monsters
I'll stand there so brave
And chase them all away
